Expected behavior

- Be considerate, friendly, and patient.
- Respect differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully.
- Focus on what is best for the community.

Unacceptable behavior

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination of any kind.
- Insults, slurs, or exclusionary language.

Reporting
If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to the project maintainers at conduct@involvex.com. All reports will be treated seriously and reviewed promptly.

Enforcement
Maintainers may take actions including warnings, temporary removal from the project, or permanent bans depending on severity and context.
